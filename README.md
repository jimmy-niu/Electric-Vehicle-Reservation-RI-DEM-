## How to run
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` to get all required packages and modules
- Run `node server.js` to start the server
- Navigate to `localhost:8080` in the browser

## Outlook testing
app.js + auth.js + pages.js comprise Outlook authentication and calendar sync. definitely buggy as for the frontend, but all functions (add event, delete event, modify event) work. use your non-brown outlook account (make one for testing if not) and create events to see if it works. 

run it with `node app.js` and then navigate to localhost:3000 (i have the app registered to localhost:3000, so hosting elsewhere won't work rn)
