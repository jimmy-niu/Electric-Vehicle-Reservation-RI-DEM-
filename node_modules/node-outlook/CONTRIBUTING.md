# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Before submitting your pull request, check the following things:

- **Did I document it?** - If you added a new function or modified the signature of a function, did you add or update the JSDOC comments? Please do this so folks can figure out how to use your cool new feature.
- **Did I rebuild the reference?** - If you updated the JSDOC, please also build the reference and include the updated **node-outlook.md** file with your pull request. You can do so with the following command:

    ```Shell
    npm run builddocs
    ```
